# Tapioca Toys Cardboard OSC Receivers for Processing
This repository is part of the Tapioca Toys Cardboard project. Learn more at https://tapioca.toys/cardboard.

Here you'll find OSC Blobs and OSC State receiving Processing sketches specially built for receiving blob and state data in the shape of OpenSoundControl messages coming from the [free OSC Blobs iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osc-blobs-tapioca-toys/id1436978667?mt=8) and [free OSC State iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osc-state-tapioca-toys/id1456542260?mt=8) that are available on the App Store.

They work with [Processing 3.3.4](https://processing.org/download/ "download Processing") and later, and its [OSC library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5).

Check out a **video demo** of the Blobs basic sketch at https://vimeo.com/291807587 and another of the Blobs flocking sketch at https://vimeo.com/388984928 and yet another of the State flow field sketch at https://vimeo.com/326081120.
