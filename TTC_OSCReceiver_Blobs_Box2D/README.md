## An OSC Blobs receiving Processing sample that generates an interaction with wandering soots
_(freely inspired by the Â© Daniel Shiffman NOC example)_

A Java-Processing sketch sample specially built for receiving blob data in the shape of OpenSoundControl messages coming from the [free OSC Blobs iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/osc-blobs-tapioca-toys/id1436978667?mt=8) that's available on the App Store.

It works with [Processing 3.3.4](https://processing.org/download/ "download Processing") and later, and its [OSC library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5).

Receive everything on the `14041` port number, use `/tapiocatoys/blob` as message pattern and check for a `iiiii` typetag. The first integer is the id of the blob, and the four others are its cartesian position (x,y) based on your phone's resolution as well as the bounding box dimensions (w,h).
